Changelog

0.1.4

Goat horn overhaul

- All 8 horn variants now actually work in combat (Admire, Yearn, and Call previously did nothing or fired only once with no duration tracking)
- Horns from any source work: goat-kill drops, raid loot, structure chests, trader trades, and /give all identify correctly via the vanilla INSTRUMENT data component instead of relying on a custom name
- Each horn plays its own instrument sound (Ponder plays Ponder, Yearn plays Yearn, etc.) — the previous code picked a random sound from the goat-horn list on every use
- Re-using a buff horn refreshes duration to max(remaining, fresh) instead of clobbering the existing effect
- Weakness debuff lifecycle: enemies hit by Admire now lose the -2 ATK after the listed turn count, ticked alongside the existing defense-penalty system
- Stale "Taunt all enemies" tooltip removed
- Pre-overhaul horns with the legacy custom-name tag continue to work (backward-compatible)
- Goat horns are now Special-class items: the player's Special affinity scales horn duration and amplifier the same way it scales potions
- Re-using a horn before its previous effect expires now stacks the amplifier (capped at MAX_HORN_AMPLIFIER) and refreshes duration — consecutive casts make the buff or debuff stronger, not shorter
- All four version shards (1.21.1, 1.21.3, 1.21.4, 1.21.5) compile and run; vanilla INSTRUMENT API drift in 1.21.5 isolated to a single helper class

Banner overhaul

- Banners now place a real, color-correct banner block on the target tile (previously the use was silent: no block, no visible AOE, no way to tell it had worked)
- Each turn, the +DEF aura is outlined by sparse happy-villager particles on every tile within manhattan distance 2 of any planted banner
- Allies inside the aura now actually get the banner DEF bonus — previously the placement message claimed they did, but only the player's damage path applied it
- New "Banner aura reduced damage by N%" message when incoming damage to the player is mitigated by a banner zone
- Banners are now Special-class items: the +2 DEF base scales with the player's Special affinity at placement time and is frozen into the tile-effect entry, so later affinity gains don't retroactively buff old banners
- Overlapping banners take the max DEF of the strongest single banner instead of stacking (no infinite +DEF from carpet-bombing)
- Banner color is preserved through the tile-effect lifecycle so all 16 vanilla colors stay visually distinct
- 16-banner enumeration is now explicit (BannerEffects helper) instead of `item.toString().contains("banner")` string sniffing
- Special-class scaling extracted into a SpecialAffinity helper used by potions, banners, and goat horns — one source of truth for the formula
- All four version shards compile and run

Wither & Poison enemy DOTs

- Enemies can now actually be Withered. Previously the splash potion of Wither was a single-hit, the Skull Sherd's "Wither IV" was implemented as poison, and there was no enemy-side wither tick at all
- Wither damage formula: `remainingTurns + 1 + amplifier + max(1, maxHp/20)` — damage is heaviest on the first tick and tapers as the curse wears off
- Poison damage formula updated to `1 + amplifier + max(1, maxHp/20)` — base 1+amp like before, but now scales with the target's max HP so DOTs stay relevant against bosses
- Splash Potion of Wither now applies a multi-turn DOT scaled by Special affinity, replacing the old single hit
- Skull Sherd "Death Mark" now applies a real Wither IV (was poison wearing a wither costume)
- New tipped Wither arrow case in PlayerCombatStats and the bow-shot pipeline — fire a tipped Wither arrow to apply 3 turns of Wither
- The previously-dead `recordWitherKill()` achievement tracker is now wired into the wither tick loop, so the FEAT_WITHERED achievement can actually be earned

0.1.3

Client fixes for all versions

- Leaving a world mid-combat no longer locks the camera into isometric view on the title screen or in every subsequent world, disconnect now resets inCombat, camera pan, focus, arena origin, trader state, and all combat stats
- Ghost hit boxes from the previous fight no longer render, tile sets and teammate hovers are cleared on disconnect too
- Guide book unlock state resets to defaults on disconnect instead of leaking bestiary unlocks from the previous world into the next
- Combat client packet receivers now dispatch to the render thread via context.client().execute, EnterCombat ExitCombat CombatSync CombatEvent VictoryChoice PlayerStats AddonBonus LevelUp TraderOffer Scoreboard Achievement and GuideBookSync were all mutating MinecraftClient state from the netty IO thread

Multiplayer fixes for all versions

- Party combat no longer deadlocks when the current turn holder disconnects, removePartyMember now reassigns this.player via switchToTurnPlayer so remaining party members can keep acting

Level select table

- Both visual halves are now clickable from every angle, the phantom half is backed by a new invisible LevelSelectGhostBlock that delegates onUse to the real block entity
- Placing an interactable block next to the level select no longer opens the level select screen when the neighbor is clicked, the overly broad UseBlockCallback that scanned all four horizontal neighbors was removed
- Breaking either half cleanly removes both and drops exactly one level select item
- Breaking the phantom half now shows the normal block breaking crack animation, ghost block renders a slab shaped cuboid with a transparent texture on the cutout render layer so the overlay has faces to draw on
- Placement now fails cleanly if the phantom position is already occupied

Bestiary

- Added entries for Zombie Villager, Cave Spider, Silverfish, Ravager, Piglin Brute, Endermite, and Llama which all spawn in biome data but had no guide book coverage
- Filled in real stats for Evoker, Phantom, Zombified Piglin, Warden, and Ender Dragon, numbers come from biomes json and the matching EnemyAI classes
- Bestiary entry count went from 53 to 60

Packaging

- owo-sentinel is no longer bundled in the jar, Modrinth auto rejects jars that include it
- owo-lib promoted from suggests to depends in fabric.mod.json so Fabric Loader itself surfaces the missing lib error that sentinel used to handle

1.21.5 only features

- Cow, pig, and chicken spawn with the new Spring to Life variants based on biome climate
- Warm biomes are desert, jungle, nether_wastes, basalt_deltas, and crimson_forest
- Cold biomes are snowy, mountain, and deep_dark
- Cow and pig removed from plains, chicken removed from forest
- Cow, pig, and chicken added to desert, jungle, snowy, and mountain so the new variants are actually visible
- Tamed animals keep their specific variant when returning to the hub
- Blue egg and brown egg are throwable combat items that deal 3 damage instead of 1
- Blue and brown egg tooltips added to the combat UI
- Cactus obstacles in desert arenas have a 50 percent chance to grow a cactus flower on top
- River arenas always spawn at least one firefly bush on the grass border around the grid

Fixes for all versions

- Players no longer spawn in the void or water after dying in combat, the hub teleport now scans for solid ground
- Tamed animals returning to the hub no longer spawn below the base, same solid-ground scan applied
- Tamed animals are no longer frozen at the hub, combat arena flags NoAI NoGravity Invulnerable Silent and the craftics_arena tag are stripped on restore
- Tipped arrows dropped from enemies or biome loot now actually apply their potion effect, bare tipped arrow stacks get a random vanilla variant assigned at delivery time
- Recipes for chainmail armor, guide book, and level select block parse on 1.21.1 again, rewritten from the string ingredient shorthand to the object form
